/**
 * Dropdown's pointer, keyboard and focus contract, driven in the browser that owns it.
 *
 * Everything here is behind an effect, a ref or a listener, so no string-rendering test can reach
 * any of it: opening moves focus into the menu, the arrow keys with Home and End walk the items,
 * a real Escape press closes the menu and hands the trigger its focus back, Tab out closes it
 * behind the user, activating an item closes it too, and a click that misses an item does not.
 *
 * Two habits the Modal checks below set, and for the same reasons. The trigger, panel and root are
 * parked on `globalThis` rather than re-queried, so every focus assertion compares element identity
 * — a selector would also match a freshly rendered element that never had focus. And every
 * assertion is a transition, a before and an after: "the menu is closed" and "focus is on the
 * trigger" are both true of a menu that never opened, which is precisely the state a broken
 * opening step leaves behind.
 *
 * Every key is a real press through `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`, and the stray click is a real
 * press-and-release through `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` at viewport coordinates. `.click()` appears
 * in three places and for one reason: opening the menu the first time, reopening it in
 * {@link reopen}, and activating a menu item. A real Enter press on a focused button does not
 * become an activation click in headless Chromium — what the Modal checks measured on a trigger,
 * and what a probe run of this file measured again on a focused `role="menuitem"` button, which
 * left the menu open at `aria-expanded="true"` with focus still on the item. So `.click()` stands
 * in for the step the browser will not perform. The consequence worth naming: the keyboard path to
 * *activating* an item belongs to the browser, and nothing here proves it, while every other key
 * this issue is about — the arrows, Home, End, Escape, Tab — is proven by a real press.
 *
 * The card holds four dropdowns; this drives the first, the icon trigger named "Row actions" over
 * three items. Its two link items point at this page's own `#inputs` route, so nothing here
 * activates one: the item that gets clicked is the third, a button.
