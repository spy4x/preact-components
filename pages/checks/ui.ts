 * Dropdown's pointer, keyboard and focus contract, driven in the browser that owns it.

 * Everything here is behind an effect, a ref or a listener, so no string-rendering test can reach
 * any of it: opening moves focus into the menu, the arrow keys with Home and End walk the items,
 * a real Escape press closes the menu and hands the trigger its focus back, Tab out closes it
 * behind the user, and activating an item closes it too.
 *
 * Two habits the Modal checks below set, and for the same reasons. The trigger, panel and root are
 * parked on `globalThis` rather than re-queried, so every focus assertion compares element identity
 * — a selector would also match a freshly rendered element that never had focus. And every
 * assertion is a transition, a before and an after: "the menu is closed" and "focus is on the
 * trigger" are both true of a menu that never opened, which is precisely the state a broken
 * opening step leaves behind.
 *
 * The keys are real presses through `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`. The trigger is activated with
 * `.click()`, which is what the Modal checks measured: a real Enter press on a focused button does
 * not become an activation click in headless Chromium, so `.click()` stands in for the one step
 * the browser will not perform. Every key under test — the arrows, Home, End, Escape, Tab — is a
 * real press.
 *
 * The card holds four dropdowns; this drives the first, the icon trigger named "Row actions" over
 * three items. Its two link items point at this page's own `#inputs` route, so nothing here
 * activates one: the item that gets clicked is the third, a button.
